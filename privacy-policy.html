        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Tripper &mdash; Photography Scouting App</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Tripper stores all your data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. The only network request the app makes is to fetch weather forecasts via a public API.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data you create in Tripper &mdash; including scouting photos, location metadata, projects, tags, planned visits, and app settings &mdash; is stored exclusively on your device. Nothing is uploaded to any server or cloud service.</p>

        <h2>2. Camera Access</h2>
        <p>Tripper uses your device camera to capture scouting photos. Photos are stored locally on your device with metadata such as GPS coordinates, compass heading, and focal length information. Camera data is never transmitted externally.</p>

        <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
        <p>Tripper accesses your location to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tag scouting photos with GPS coordinates</li>
            <li>Show nearby scouting locations on the map</li>
            <li>Calculate sun and moon positions for photography planning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Location data is stored only on your device as part of your photo metadata. The only exception is when fetching weather forecasts (see Section 6).</p>

        <h2>4. Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>Tripper can save scouting photos to your device photo library and import reference images from it. This data stays on your device and is not shared externally.</p>

        <h2>5. ARKit (Augmented Reality)</h2>
        <p>On supported devices, Tripper uses ARKit to help you revisit scouting locations with positional tracking. AR world maps and position data are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to any server.</p>

        <h2>6. Weather Data</h2>
        <p>Tripper fetches weather forecasts from the <a href="https://open-meteo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open-Meteo API</a>, a free and open-source weather service. When requesting a forecast, your location's GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) are sent to Open-Meteo's servers. No other personal data is included in this request. Open-Meteo's own privacy policy applies to their handling of these requests.</p>

        <h2>7. Notifications</h2>
        <p>Tripper can send local push notifications to remind you of planned photography visits. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external notification service or server.</p>

        <h2>8. Export &amp; Import</h2>
        <p>Tripper allows you to export your photo database (including settings) as a ZIP file and import it on another device. This export is a local file operation &mdash; the file is created on your device and shared only through methods you choose (e.g., AirDrop, Files app).</p>

        <h2>9. No Analytics, No Tracking</h2>
        <p>Tripper does not include any analytics frameworks, crash reporting tools, advertising SDKs, or tracking mechanisms. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or behavioral data of any kind.</p>

        <h2>10. No User Accounts</h2>
        <p>Tripper does not require or offer user accounts, login, or registration. There is no server-side component that stores your data.</p>

        <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The only third-party service Tripper communicates with is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> (open-meteo.com) &mdash; for weather forecast data, receiving only GPS coordinates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that collect user data are used.</p>

        <h2>12. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Tripper does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the app does not collect personal data from any user, it is safe for users of all ages.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version at this URL with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
